scalajs-rx-idb
==============

Indexed Database reactive (Rx) wrapper written in [scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) using [monifu](monifu.org) and [utest](https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest).

Primarily it is trying to be user friendly, resilient, ..., just Rx based... 

Working with IndexedDb directly is not that easy as one might expect. 

NOTE: 

* It currently depends on scala-js 0.6.0-SNAPSHOT and unaccepted [utest PR](https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest/pull/40)
* Just the basic operations are implemented and tested so far
